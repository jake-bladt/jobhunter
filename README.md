## Jobhunter

The purpose of this application is to allow users to track and manage a job search. While there are
many, many websites available for advertising jobs and finding job leads, there are few if any resources
specifically purposed to allow the job seekers to pull together the information about a job search into
a coherent whole. Jobhunter aims to fill that need.

In addition to being a functional application, Jobhunter is a full-lifecycle Ruby on Rails application
using AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap. Documentation will be included to help follow the technology used
to create it and licensing will be sufficiently open than anyone should feel free to clone or fork it.
